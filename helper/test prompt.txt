The RAG chatbot returns 'query failed' for any content-related questions.
I need you to:
1. Write tests to evaluate the outputs of the execute method of the CourseSearchTool in @backend/search_tools.py
2. Write tests to evaluate if @backend/ai_generator.py correctly calls for the CourseSearchTool
3. Write tests to evaluate how the RAG system is handling the content-query related questions.

Save the tests in a tests folder within @backend. Run those tests against the current system to identify which components are failing. Propose fixes based on what the tests reveal is broken.

Think a lot
